							Supportive sister
							<h4 class="party-card-subheader">Favorite Memory:</h4>
							We celebrated Sarah's 30th birthday party with her friends in Vegas and that was a blast. I also dragged Sarah and one of her friends to a parking lot behind the MGM where we hopped into some fancy cars for a random video shoot and petted a baby tiger...years later we recognized the people we met with the tiger when watching Tiger King.

							Oakland, CA
							<h4 class="party-card-subheader">Best Trait:</h4>
							Best hype girl ever
							<h4 class="party-card-subheader">Favorite Memory:</h4>
							I first met Anna at the airport in Indianapolis on a recruitment trip when we were in college, where I learned she is a light weight with alcohol and an open book to everyone. Anna is the best for her openness about anything and everything.

							Detroit Lakes, MN
							<h4 class="party-card-subheader">Best Trait:</h4>
							Sweet & caring
							<h4 class="party-card-subheader">Favorite Memory:</h4>
							Care and I grew up in Minnesota together and I spent a lot of time with her family at their house eating their leftovers or running around the resort her family owned. The best was probably driving the golf carts very recklessly where it wasn't uncommon for someone to fall out if they weren't strapped in. (Where you strap in a golf bag, that's where you strap yourself in.)

							Allison and I met in college through our sorority at ASU where we went to a few parties together. We continued the fun post graduation and have taken a few trips to Vegas where my fave was when Allison twerked on Diplo's DJ booth (to which he said, just don't fall) and I cheered her on because I couldn't commit to not falling...and lets be real, I still don't know how to twerk.

							April and I have lived in quite a few of the same places: grew up together in Minnesota, some college time in Arizona, and prime years in San Francisco. My favorite call I got was when she told me she was moving to SF. When she introduced me to her SF roommates, she warned them, "you will be seeing her a lot." And I proceeded to spend 50% of my weekends at April's apartment on Hyde st.

							 When I was a freshman in high school my teachers claimed that I was disruptive. My counselor was coming down on me hard. I told my brother this. He proceeded to interview all of my teachers and document his findings, which conflicted with my counselor’s negative view of me. He then presented these findings to my counselor who promptly transferred me to a new counselor, who I loved!

							I met Paul freshman year on the soccer team. After practice he'd say, "if you take the freeway to your house then mine is on the way." On a few occasions I learned just how long the bus ride was from the Outer Sunset to Potrero Hill. His ability to persuade and create fun has kept me by his side.
